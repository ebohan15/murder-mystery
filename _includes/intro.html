As the party was winding down the company CEO, Richard DeVaul, went into his office to retrieve a speech he prepared. After he had not returned for some time, a coworker entered his office and found him dead. The police were called and everyone remaining at the party was interviewed, eventually the case went cold.  A few years later the case was reopened and now it is your job to find the killer.t.
